iTunes Connect Downloader
=========================

This small app will download reports from iTunes Connect on a daily basis
and upload those reports to S3. After uploading to S3, it can also run a
summary report over all those files. The summary report will generate
daily download and cumulative download graphs which are then emailed to
a specific email address.


Installation / Setup / Usage
----------------------------

This is designed to run on Heroku using
the [Heroku Scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler) on
a daily basis. Add the scheduler add-on to your app with:

```bash
heroku addons:add scheduler:standard
```

You'll want to make sure several environment variables are defined, or you can
pass everything in as flags to the `main.py` script. Run `reporter/main.py -h`
for a list of all the options. To set up this script to run on Heroku, you can
set the config for the app as follows:

```bash
heroku config:set ITUNES_CONNECT_LOGIN="..." \
    ITUNES_CONNECT_PASSWORD="..." \
    ITUNES_CONNECT_VENDORID="..." \
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..." \
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..." \
    AWS_BUCKET="bucket-name" \
    MAILTO="email@example.com" \
    SMTP_HOST="mail.example.com" \
    SMTP_PORT=587 \
    SMTP_LOGIN="user@example.com" \
    SMTP_PASSWORD="..."
```

If you've set up your environment correctly, you can invoke the script with the
following in your scheduler config. This will generate both daily and weekly
reports.

```bash
python reporter/main.py --download --daily-summary --weekly-summary -q
```

You can also run the report manually on Heroku by executing the following command:

```bash
heroku run python reporter/main.py --download --daily-summary --weekly-summary -q
```


Running Locally
---------------

This can also be run locally. Either export your environment variables the
same as you would on Heroku, or pass in everything as command line arguments.
Then install the Python requirements and run the reporter:

```bash
virtualenv venv && source venv/bin/activate
# Or mkvirtualenv itunes-downloader for virtualenvwrapper folk
pip install -r requirements.txt
./reporter/main.py --download --daily-summary --weekly-summary
```
